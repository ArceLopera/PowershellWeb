## Powershell 5 and Powershell ISE

PowerShell 5 is a major version of the Windows PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language that was released in February 2016. It was designed primarily for Windows operating systems and provides a powerful tool for automating administrative tasks and managing systems.

Some of the key features of PowerShell 5 include:

+ Classes and enums for creating custom types
+ Enhanced debugging support, including the ability to step through scripts and inspect variables
+ Improved security with the introduction of Just Enough Administration (JEA) and PowerShell Scriptblock Logging

PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is included with PowerShell 5. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for developing, testing, and debugging PowerShell scripts and modules. Some of the key features of PowerShell ISE include:

+ A code editor with syntax highlighting, code folding, and IntelliSense
+ A console pane for executing PowerShell commands and scripts
+ Debugging tools, including breakpoints and variable inspection
+ Integration with version control systems like Git and Team Foundation Server

PowerShell ISE was designed to make it easier for developers and system administrators to work with PowerShell scripts and modules, but it has been deprecated in favor of the new PowerShell 7 Integrated Console. The PowerShell 7 Integrated Console provides many of the same features as PowerShell ISE, but in a more modern and flexible interface that can be used on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Key Differences between Powershell 7 and 5

### Cross-Platform Support
One of the biggest differences between PowerShell 7 and 5 is cross-platform support. While PowerShell 5 was primarily designed for Windows operating systems, PowerShell 7 is designed to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This means that you can use PowerShell 7 to manage and automate tasks on a wide variety of systems, making it a more versatile tool.

### Improved Performance
PowerShell 7 is also faster and more efficient than PowerShell 5. This is due in part to the fact that PowerShell 7 uses .NET Core 3.x, which provides better performance than the .NET Framework used by PowerShell 5. In addition, PowerShell 7 includes a number of performance optimizations that make it faster and more responsive.

### New Features
PowerShell 7 includes many new features and improvements over PowerShell 5. Some of the most notable new features include:

+ **Pipeline Parallelization**: PowerShell 7 can execute commands in parallel on multi-core CPUs, improving performance for certain operations.
+ **Ternary Operators**: PowerShell 7 introduces a new ternary operator (condition ? true : false) that makes it easier to write concise code.
+ **New Data Types**: PowerShell 7 adds support for new data types like System.Text.Json.JsonDocument, making it easier to work with JSON data.
+ **New cmdlets**: PowerShell 7 includes many new cmdlets for managing systems and applications, as well as improved versions of existing cmdlets.

### Compatibility
Finally, it's worth noting that PowerShell 7 is not fully backwards-compatible with PowerShell 5. While most scripts and modules written for PowerShell 5 should work fine in PowerShell 7, there may be some compatibility issues with certain scripts or modules. It's always a good idea to test your scripts and modules in PowerShell 7 before deploying them to production systems.

## PowerShell 7 Integrated Console in VSCode

PowerShell 7 Integrated Console is a new feature in PowerShell 7 that provides many of the same features as PowerShell ISE, but in a more modern and flexible interface that can be used on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Here are some of the key differences between the two:

### Cross-Platform Support
One of the biggest differences between PowerShell 7 Integrated Console and PowerShell ISE is cross-platform support. While PowerShell ISE was primarily designed for Windows operating systems, PowerShell 7 Integrated Console is designed to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This means that you can use PowerShell 7 Integrated Console to manage and automate tasks on a wide variety of systems, making it a more versatile tool.

### Improved Performance
PowerShell 7 Integrated Console is also faster and more efficient than PowerShell ISE. This is due in part to the fact that PowerShell 7 uses .NET Core 3.x, which provides better performance than the .NET Framework used by PowerShell ISE. In addition, PowerShell 7 Integrated Console includes a number of performance optimizations that make it faster and more responsive.

### Features
PowerShell 7 Integrated Console includes many of the same features as PowerShell ISE, such as a code editor with syntax highlighting, code folding, and IntelliSense, a console pane for executing PowerShell commands and scripts, and debugging tools like breakpoints and variable inspection. However, PowerShell 7 Integrated Console also includes some new features, such as:

+ **Interactive Notebooks**: PowerShell 7 Integrated Console includes a new feature called Interactive Notebooks, which provides a way to create and share rich documents that combine text, code, and output. This feature is similar to Jupyter Notebooks in the Python world.
+ **Multiple Tabs**: PowerShell 7 Integrated Console supports multiple tabs, so you can work on multiple scripts or tasks at the same time within the same window.
+ **Improved UI**: PowerShell 7 Integrated Console has a modern and flexible user interface that can be customized to suit your needs.

### Deprecation
Finally, it's worth noting that PowerShell ISE has been deprecated in favor of PowerShell 7 Integrated Console. Microsoft has stated that PowerShell ISE will not receive any new features or updates, and it will be removed in future versions of Windows. While PowerShell ISE will still be available in older versions of Windows that include PowerShell 5, it's recommended that you switch to PowerShell 7 Integrated Console for new development and management tasks.

### Additional Features of VSCode Powershell Extension
The PowerShell extension for VSCode includes a number of additional features that aren't available in PowerShell 7 Integrated Console, such as:

+ **Code Snippets**: The extension provides a library of code snippets that you can use to quickly insert common PowerShell commands and structures into your code.
+ **Task Runner**: You can use the extension's Task Runner to automate repetitive tasks like running tests, building modules, or deploying scripts.
+ **Integrated Source Control**: The extension includes support for integrated source control, so you can use Git or another version control system directly from within the VSCode editor.

Overall, the PowerShell extension for VSCode provide powerful tools for working with PowerShell scripts and modules.
