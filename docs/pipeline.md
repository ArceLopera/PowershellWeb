The pipeline in PowerShell is a feature that allows you to take the output of one command and pass it as input to another command. This makes it possible to create more complex commands by chaining simple commands together. The pipeline operator, represented by the "|" character, is used to connect commands together.

Here are some examples of how to use the pipeline in PowerShell:

## Example 1: Get-ChildItem and Select-Object
The Get-ChildItem command is used to list the files and folders in a specified directory. The Select-Object command is used to select specific properties of the objects returned by Get-ChildItem. By using the pipeline, you can pass the output of Get-ChildItem to Select-Object to filter the results.

``` pwsh 
Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime
```

This command lists the files and folders in the current directory and then selects the Name, Length, and LastWriteTime properties of each item.

## Example 2: Get-Process and Sort-Object

The Get-Process command is used to list the running processes on a system. The Sort-Object command is used to sort the results based on a specific property. By using the pipeline, you can pass the output of Get-Process to Sort-Object to sort the results by CPU usage.

``` pwsh
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending
```

This command lists the running processes and then sorts them in descending order based on their CPU usage.

## Example 3: Get-Service and Where-Object

The Get-Service command is used to list the services on a system. The Where-Object command is used to filter the results based on a specific condition. By using the pipeline, you can pass the output of Get-Service to Where-Object to filter the results to only show services that are currently running.

```
Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq "Running"
```

This command lists all of the services on the system and then filters the results to only show services that have a Status property equal to "Running".

In each of these examples, the pipeline is used to pass the output of one command to another command. This allows you to create more powerful commands by combining simple commands together.
