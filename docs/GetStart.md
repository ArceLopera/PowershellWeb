Getting started with PowerShell is easy, and here are the steps to help you:

## Find and run PowerShell

PowerShell is pre-installed on most modern Windows operating systems. To find it, click on the "Start" menu, type "PowerShell" in the search box, and select the "Windows PowerShell" or "PowerShell 7" option depending on which version you want to use. Alternatively, you can press the "Windows Key + X" key combination and select "Windows PowerShell" from the Power User menu.

## Check the PowerShell version 

To check which version of PowerShell you have installed, open a PowerShell session and run the following command:

``` pwsh
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

This will display the PowerShell version number and other version-related information, such as the CLR version, the .NET Framework version, and the OS version.

## Update PowerShell 

If you have an older version of PowerShell, you can update it to the latest version. To do this, open a PowerShell session with administrator privileges and run the following command:
``` pwsh
Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force
Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force
Update-Module PowerShellGet
```
This will update the PowerShell package provider and the PowerShellGet module, which you can then use to update PowerShell to the latest version.

## Use PowerShell help 

PowerShell includes a comprehensive help system that you can use to learn about PowerShell cmdlets, functions, and modules. To use the help system, open a PowerShell session and run the following command:
``` pwsh
Get-Help <cmdlet or topic>
```

Replace <cmdlet or topic> with the name of the cmdlet or topic you want to learn about. For example, to learn about the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, you would run the following command:
``` pwsh
Get-Help Get-ChildItem
```
This will display the help information for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, including a description, syntax, parameters, examples, and related topics.

By following these steps, you can get started with PowerShell, check for its version, update it to the latest version, and use the built-in help system to learn more about PowerShell and its various features.

## More on the use of Get-Help

The Get-Help cmdlet is a powerful feature of PowerShell that provides help information for cmdlets, functions, modules, and other PowerShell components. Here are some examples of how to use the Get-Help cmdlet:

* **Get help for a specific cmdlet:** To get help for a specific cmdlet, run the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help <cmdlet name>
    ```
    Replace <cmdlet name> with the name of the cmdlet you want to learn about. For example, to get help for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, you would run the following command:

    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help Get-ChildItem
    ```
    This will display the help information for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, including a description, syntax, parameters, examples, and related topics.

* **Get help for a specific parameter:** To get help for a specific parameter of a cmdlet, run the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help <cmdlet name> -Parameter <parameter name>
    ``` 
    Replace <cmdlet name> with the name of the cmdlet and <parameter name> with the name of the parameter you want to learn about. For example, to get help for the Path parameter of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, you would run the following command:

    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Parameter Path
    ```
    This will display the help information for the Path parameter of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet.

* **Get help for a specific topic:** To get help for a specific topic, such as operators or variables, run the following command:

    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help <topic>
    ```
    Replace <topic> with the name of the topic you want to learn about. For example, to get help for operators, you would run the following command:

    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help about_operators
    ```
    This will display the help information for operators in PowerShell.

* **Use wildcard with Get-Help:** You can use wildcard characters to search for cmdlets or topics that match a certain pattern. For example, to search for all cmdlets that start with "Get", you would run the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-Help Get-*
    ```
    This will display help information for all cmdlets that start with "Get", including Get-ChildItem, Get-Item, Get-Process, and others.

In summary, the Get-Help cmdlet is a valuable tool for learning about PowerShell and its various components. By using Get-Help with different parameters and wildcard characters, you can quickly find the information you need and improve your PowerShell skills.

## Wildcard Use

Wildcard characters are special characters that are used to search for text patterns in PowerShell commands. They are extremely useful for finding cmdlets, functions, files, or any other data that matches a specific pattern. Here are the most commonly used wildcard characters in PowerShell:

+ *** (asterisk):** 
    This is the most common wildcard character in PowerShell. It matches any number of characters, including none. For example, if you want to find all files with the extension ".txt" in a directory, you can use the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-ChildItem C:\Users\username\Documents\*.txt
    ```
    This command will list all files with the ".txt" extension in the "Documents" folder of the user "username".

+ **? (question mark):** 
    This wildcard character matches any single character. For example, if you want to find all files that have a name consisting of a single character followed by "file.txt", you can use the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-ChildItem C:\Users\username\Documents\?file.txt
    ```
    This command will list all files that have a name consisting of a single character followed by "file.txt" in the "Documents" folder of the user "username".

+ **[ ] (brackets):** 
    This wildcard character matches any single character that is included in the brackets. For example, if you want to find all files that have a name starting with the letters "a", "b", or "c", you can use the following command:
    ``` pwsh
    Get-ChildItem C:\Users\username\Documents\[abc]*.*
    ```
    This command will list all files that have a name starting with the letters "a", "b", or "c" in the "Documents" folder of the user "username".

Wildcard characters can also be used with other PowerShell commands, such as Select-String, which searches for text patterns in files or other data. For example, if you want to search for all occurrences of the word "example" in a file, you can use the following command:

``` pwsh
Select-String C:\Users\username\Documents\example.txt -Pattern "ex*le"
``` 
This command will search for all occurrences of the word "example" in the "example.txt" file, using the asterisk as a wildcard character to match any characters between "ex" and "le".

In summary, wildcard characters are powerful tools in PowerShell that allow you to find patterns in data quickly and easily. By using the right combination of wildcard characters and other PowerShell commands, you can automate many repetitive tasks and save yourself a lot of time and effort.
